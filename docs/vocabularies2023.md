# SIBiLS Vocabularies - version 3.1 (2023)

## Mapped vocabularies

"An ontology is a formal representation of a body of knowledges within a given domain. Ontologies usually consist of a set of classes (or terms or concepts) with relations that operate between them."

These are the various terminologies used to create annotations.
