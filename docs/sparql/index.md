## Introduction

The SIBiLS SPARQL endpoint allows to run SPARQL queries on a subset of annotated PMC publications. The textual content and structure (title, sections, paragraphs, etc.) is described as well as a list of named entities (multidimensional concepts) found and located in the full text of the publications. The ontology used to describe the publications can be found here. The triple store contains a sample of 3000 publications at the moment. The content of the triple store will be extended in the future and include alternate publication sources as well.
