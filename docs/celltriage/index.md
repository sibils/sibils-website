## Introduction

**CellTriage** is a service designed to assist the curators of the **[Cellosaurus]( https://www.cellosaurus.org/)** database in identifying literature relevant to the characterization of **cell lines**. The curation process involves reviewing a large number of publications to extract information about cell lines, such as their properties and origin.

CellTriage uses **large language models** pre-trained on biomedical texts and fine-tuned to identify relevant publications. It ranks new abstracts from MEDLINE and full-text articles from PubMed Central on a weekly basis, assigning each publication a score based on the likelihood that it contains useful information for Cellosaurus. This **triage** system helps curators efficiently focus on the most valuable studies, enabling them to prioritize their efforts.

CellTriage's **scalable** design helps ensure that the Cellosaurus database remains comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date.
