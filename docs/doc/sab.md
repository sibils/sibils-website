# The Scientific Advisory Board

The SIB Literature Services Advisory Board meets annually and advises on all aspects of the Literature Databases and Services, putting the development of these resources in the context of the scientific community within Europe and beyond. More specifically for Europe PMC, they review progress on the development of the service over the past year, and the plans for development for the forthcoming year. Members of the SAB are usually appointed for 4 years. During 2021-2023, the organisation of the event was made possible thanks to fundings from the e-BioDiv project.
