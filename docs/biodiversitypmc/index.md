# Biodiversity PMC

Based on **[SIBiLS](../index.md)**, **Biodiversity PMC** is gathering publications to serve not only life and health scientists but also researchers interested in **biodiversity** and related sciences (e.g., ecology, environmental sciences, taxonomists). It is based on PubMed Central (PMC) full-text publications and MEDLINE citations under the umbrella of **[PMC International program](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/pmci/)**, a program of the National Library of Medicine. Biodiversity PMC is **augmented with additional articles**, not originally references into PMC and coming from various publishers (e.g. Pensoft), as well as from about a million **taxonomic treatments from [Plazi](https://plazi.org/)**.

The resulting collection covers a wider span of disciplines than the NLM's PMC and is therefore of particular interest for taxonomists, ecologists and all those interested in monitoring or studying the evolution of biodiversity. Thanks to this richer set of publications, the resource can be regarded as a concrete step towards the delivery of a **One Health library**.
